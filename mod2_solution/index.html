I am so enjoying this course. Learning HTML, CSS and Javascript on Coursera is fun.
The facilitator really broke down the nitty-gritty of what the course entails and he sure does know how to carry his class along.
If someone had told me I could learn how to programme in HTML within a short period of time, I would have argued.
Thank you so much for this opportunity.</section>
